The Comma.ai comma logo is trademarked by Comma.ai
http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4802:l3n0p6.6.4

As a man who believes everyone should have options despite my feelings 
I (Coltonton) would like to include the default files that their eons came
With. So if they ever want to go back, and their backup was destroyed they can! 
The Comma logo is property of Comma.ai and I do not own it. The included
"Trademarked" files can be found on their GitHub and are free for any person to use
I am simply another form to distribute it.
